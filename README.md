## Lab: 31 - Sprint 2 Milestone 1

### Consumer Site (The Storefront)
We’ll now switch our attention to the consumer side of our online storefront, building out a system whereby our potential customers can register for an account and shop for products. While we’ll allow them to shop and browse, it’s imperative that shoppers not be permitted to add an item to their cart until they’ve both registered for an account and are logged in.

### User Stories and Tasks
As a user, I would like to see products available for sale so that I can browse through the inventory for purchase.
As a user, I would like to register for an account on the site, so that I can make purchases
As a user, I would like to securely login to my account so that I can add products to my shopping cart
