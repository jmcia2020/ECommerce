### Consumer Site (The Storefront)
We’ll now switch our attention to the consumer side of our online storefront, building out a system whereby our potential customers can register for an account and shop for products. While we’ll allow them to shop and browse, it’s imperative that shoppers not be permitted to add an item to their cart until they’ve both registered for an account and are logged in.

### User Stories and Tasks
As a user, I would like to see products available for sale so that I can browse through the inventory for purchase.
As a user, I would like to register for an account on the site, so that I can make purchases
As a user, I would like to securely login to my account so that I can add products to my shopping cart

### Consumer Site (The Shopping Cart)
Now that we have valid users, and the ability to browse the inventory, it’s time to allow our registered customers the ability to add items to their “Shopping Cart”

This is going to require both a shopping cart page where they can view the full contents of what they’re about to purchase as well as a mini-cart component that can be used on any page.

### User Stories and Tasks
As a user, I would like a way to store the items I wish to purchase in a cart within the application.
As a user, I would like the ability to view my desired purchases while browsing the other products on the site.
As a user I would like a dedicated page where I can view all the products I wish to purpose all in one location.
